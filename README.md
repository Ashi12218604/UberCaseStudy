## 🚗 Machine Learning for Traffic Prediction and Analysis

### Project Goal

This repository contains a system designed to forecast traffic conditions and analyze congestion patterns using machine learning. The project involves processing diverse datasets, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find patterns, isolating peak traffic hours, and constructing predictive models to estimate future traffic flow.

### Key Capabilities

  * **Consolidated Data Pipeline**: Merges primary traffic data with supplementary information, such as local weather conditions and public event schedules.
  * **Congestion Analysis**: Automatically identifies and visualizes high-traffic periods and peak hours from the data.
  * **Predictive Modeling**: Leverages **XGBoost** to build a robust model for traffic forecasting.
  * **Model Interpretability**: Employs **SHAP values** to explain the model's predictions and determine which factors (e.g., time of day, weather) have the most impact.
  * **Dynamic Visualization**: Includes a suite of plots and charts for exploring the data and evaluating model performance.

### ⚙️ How to Use the System

#### Run Peak Hour Analysis

To execute the peak hour analysis script directly from your terminal:

```bash
python peak_hour_analysis.py
```

#### Interactive Notebooks

For a more detailed, step-by-step analysis and model building, you can use the Jupyter notebooks:

  * `uber_traffic_analysis.ipynb`: Focuses on the exploratory data analysis of the Uber dataset.
  * `model.ipynb`: Contains the full workflow for model exploration, training, and evaluation.

### 📊 Outputs and Reports

All generated outputs, including model performance metrics and charts, are stored in the `results/` directory.

**Generated files include:**

  * Model performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²)
  * Feature importance and SHAP plots
  * Time series prediction charts
  * Visualizations from the peak hour analysis

**Detailed written analyses are available in:**

  * `Research Report.pdf`
  * `Peak Hour Analysis Report.pdf`
  * `Model Evaluation and Refinement Report.pdf`
